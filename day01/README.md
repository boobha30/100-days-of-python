# Python 100 Days of Code

## Day 1 – Python Basics
**Date:** December 30  
**Topics Covered:** Variables, Printing, User Input  
**Project:** Band name generator 

### What I Learned
Basic Coding: use PyCharm 

	→ Print:  print("Hello World")

	→ String manipulation:  print("Hello World\n Hello World")
	                                      -> Hello World
	                                           Hello World
	
	→ Get user input:   input("What is your name?")
                                        -> What is your name? ____
	If user want to input a specific data type which is used later: int(input("Tell me a number: " ))

	→ Variables:  name= input ( " What is your name?")
                              print ( " hello "  + name )
                             -> What is your name? boobha
                             hello boobha

	→ Length: print (Len(name))
                        -> 6
